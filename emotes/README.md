**Notes:**

* If you only know _one_ emote of a category it will NOT be listed in its category but on the main emote wheel. i.e. If you know only _Blow Kiss_ it won't be in the Flirt category until you learn others such as _Come Here._

* The **Category** is where it can be found in the emote wheel after you have learnt it.

* There used to be TWO _Come Here_ emotes but was fixed in Age of Sorcery Chapter 3.

> The "Come Here" emote was present with the same name under "Flirt" and "Greet". We have renamed these variations to "Come here" and "Come over here" to reflect the mortalness of the combat these emotes can bring.

# Coordinates

Press `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`Alt`-`L` to toggle displaying your location coordinates. If you are not familiar with the X, Y, Z coordinates displayed know that Conan Exiles uses Unreal Engine 4 which uses a Left-Handed Coordinate system:

  * +X is East (+9999 is towards the Jungle, -9999 is towards Sepermeru)
  * +Y is South
  * +Z is Up (+8600 top, -20000 is the bottom of _Skulker's End_)
